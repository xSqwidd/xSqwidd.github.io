### Issues with the design:
* The doors to the elevator shut very quickly. If the user was handicapped or in a group, the doors may begin closing before they had entered.
* The lights on top are not clear what their purpose is.
* Top buttons may be hard to reach for people in wheelchairs.
* Alarm and call buttons are very close to open/close door buttons. These may be accidentally bumped.
* Alarm and call buttons are the same color as the rest of the buttons. While it looks nice aesthetically, they are not distinguishable from the rest of the buttons.
* Floor display is hard to read. Numbers are not always clear due to small space between lines.

### Good aspects of the design:
* The buttons are clearly labeled and in braille.
* When a button is pushed, the light around it turns from white to red, and a beep sound is played.
* A noise is played as the elevator moves from floor to floor.
* When the elevator reaches its destination, a different sound is played.
* There is a sign inside and outside the elevator saying they are not active during a fire.
* Maximum weight is displayed in both pounds and kilograms.
* First floor is separated from the rest with a star next to the number.
* Call button has text informing the user to press for help, light will flash when call is answered.


## B Requirements:

### Common uses:
* Traveling up and down floors.
* Transporting objects up and down floors.

### Uncommon uses:
* Open and close door buttons.

### Rare uses:
* Alarm / Call buttons.

The interface makes these actions easier. Clearly labeled and easy-to-reach buttons help show the user how to interact with it, regardless of age.
Buttons to open and close the doors make it easier to move objects into the elevator, to let another person into the elevator, or to get to your destination quicker.

### Interaction Sequence:
* Call elevator from lobby.
* Enter elevator
* Press desired floor.
* Wait.
* Exit elevator at selected floor.
