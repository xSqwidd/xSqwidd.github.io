## C Requirements:
I chose to create my design in a modular style. I wanted the user to be able to keep the features that are important to them, while eliminating
ones that they did not want or need.

The Health Stats and Social Feed both have four icons that can be tapped to change the displayed tab. In the settings, the user will be able to add/remove
connections that they use. For example, if they do not have Facebook, they can remove the icon for it.

By opening the Settings, the user can rearrange the locations of the display windows. This allows them to make the mirror tailored to their needs.

The Clock display shows the current Date and Time.

The Calendar displays the five soonest events or holidays.

The Weather shows either a five-day forecast, or an hourly forecast, depending on the users' preferences.

The News feed is synced to other News apps the user may have, so that their feed is personalized to their likes.

The Health Stats display shows a graph of the users stats for the week and compares it to previous weeks.
There are four categories to show: Sleep, Exercise, Weight, and Mirror Time.
Sleep displays the hours of sleep, or the hours of deep sleep.
Exercise displays the number of steps taken, or the hours spent exercising.
Weight displays the user's weight.
Mirror Time displays the amount of time the user spends in front of the mirror.

The Media Feed connects to other apps the user may have. The user can see a glance at their recently recieved text messages, see new Tweets, 
recent Instagram posts, and recent Facebook posts.

Below is the Sketch of my Mirror.
